# DSBA QT Install Issues
I will throw away this repo in 2 weeks if I don't forget....

## Instructions

0. Check the closed issues for solutions
1. Click "[Issues](https://github.com/NChechulin/dsba-qt-install-issues/issues)" in the top bar
2. Find a green button "Create new issue"
3. Select a template and click get started
4. Fill in all the neccessary information
5. Click "Preview" to check that it renders correctly
6. Wait...

We will communicate using **only** issues and comments because we want the solutions to be public.
