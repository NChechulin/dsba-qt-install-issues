# DSBA QT Install Issues
I will throw away this repo in 2 weeks if I don't forget....

## Instructions

1. **Check the closed issues for solutions**
2. Click "[Issues](https://github.com/NChechulin/dsba-qt-install-issues/issues)" in the top bar
3. Find a green button "Create new issue"
4. Select a template and click "Get started"
5. Fill in all the requested information
6. Click "Preview" to check that it renders correctly
7. Wait...

We will communicate using **only** issues and comments because we want the solutions to be public.
